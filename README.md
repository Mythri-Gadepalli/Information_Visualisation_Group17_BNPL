Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) Analysis Project

Project Overview:
This project aims to analyze the impact of Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) models on customer behavior, merchant sales, and credit risk in the e-commerce sector. Through data-driven insights, we investigate BNPL adoption trends, loan purposes, default patterns, and seasonal variations to provide a comprehensive understanding of BNPLâ€™s role in modern finance.


Key Objectives:
Identify Primary Loan Purposes and Seasonal Trends: Analyze the distribution of loan purposes and identify patterns over time.
Segment BNPL Growth by Income Levels: Track BNPL adoption segmented by income groups to understand which demographics drive growth.
Evaluate Loan Default Patterns: Study default trends to assess potential risks and long-term financial impacts.


Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
Loan Default Rate: Percentage of loans that default.
Customer Adoption Rate: Growth in BNPL usage.
Average Loan Size: Mean value of loans issued.
Repayment Rate: Percentage of loans repaid on time.
